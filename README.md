**Lulbaite** is a Spigot/Paper scripting plugin.
Using Lulbaite, you can write Lua scripts to add functionality to your server.

**Disclaimer: Java and Spigot API knowledge is required.** This plugin is **not** a beginner-friendly scripting plugin.
Basically Lulbaite just lets you write regular Java plugin functionality,
except that you write Lua with LuaJ.

However, the purpose of this plugin is to act as a quick and dirty way
to script a simple feature or to automate something,
instead of trying to be a full-blown plugin framework.
